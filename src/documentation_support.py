            "Introduction": "The PRD outlines the specifications for an object detection and tracking system that leverages the YOLOv7 algorithm to segment objects in uploaded videos. The system will detect and track objects in real-time and generate a JavaScript After Effects (AE) JSX file with null objects corresponding to each detected object.",
            "Product Overview": "The object detection and tracking system provide automated video segmentation by utilizing YOLOv7, an advanced computer vision algorithm. It enables precise identification and tracking of objects in videos, allowing for enhanced editing and visual effects.",
            "Video Upload and Processing": "Allow users to upload videos to the system for processing and object detection. Ensure compatibility with common video formats (e.g., MP4, AVI) and handle large video files efficiently.",
            "Object Detection using YOLOv7": "Implement the YOLOv7 algorithm for accurate and real-time object detection in videos. Detect a wide range of objects, including people, vehicles, animals, and various everyday objects.",
            "Object Tracking": "Track detected objects across video frames, providing smooth and continuous tracking of moving objects. Utilize advanced tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter, correlation tracking) for robust tracking performance.",
            "Null Object Generation": "Generate a JavaScript After Effects (AE) JSX file with null objects corresponding to each detected object. Each null object will have its position and orientation data based on the object's tracked trajectory.",
            "Deployment and Integration": "Deploy the system as a web-based application accessible via a secure website. Integrate with popular video editing software, such as Adobe After Effects, to facilitate seamless import of the generated JSX file.",
            "User Interface and Interactions": "Develop a user-friendly web interface for video upload, processing, and result visualization. Provide interactive controls for users to adjust detection and tracking parameters, if applicable.",
            "Performance and Scalability": "Optimize system performance for real-time object detection and tracking, ensuring efficient utilization of computational resources. Design the system to handle concurrent video processing and support scaling based on user demand.",
            "Security and Privacy": "Implement security measures to protect user-uploaded videos and ensure user data privacy. Comply with relevant data protection regulations and handle user data responsibly.",
            "Future Enhancements": "Explore integrating additional computer vision algorithms for more accurate object detection and tracking. Expand compatibility with other video editing software beyond After Effects.",
            "Release and Deployment Process": "Define a release and deployment process, including versioning, testing, and CI/CD pipelines, to ensure smooth and efficient deployments."
